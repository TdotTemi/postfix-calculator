Post-Fix-Calculator
=======================

WHAT IS THIS??

This program converts an infix ,normal way we are used to seeing mathematical expressions, into a postfix where the operands occur after 
the operands to which they apply.  It then evaluates the postfix expression and outputs the result.

The user can enter a expression whose characters are separated by a space.

The user can enter any single or multi-digit positive or negative operand.

The user can enter a whole or decimal operand.

The user can enter any operation.  If an operation is not supported by the program, an InvalidOperationException will be thrown.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE?

The purpose of this project was to get familiarize myself with hash maps and stack data structures as well as to further develop my 
algorithmic thinking.
